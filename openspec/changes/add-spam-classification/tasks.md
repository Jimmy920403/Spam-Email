## Phase 1 — Baseline (SVM)
- [ ] 1.1 Add `scripts/download_dataset.py` that downloads the raw CSV from GitHub raw URL into `data/` (do not commit dataset unless license permits).
- [ ] 1.2 Add `scripts/preprocess.py` for text cleaning and TF-IDF vectorization. Include unit tests for core functions.
- [ ] 1.3 Add `scripts/train_baseline.py` to train an SVM classifier and save the model artifact to `models/`.
- [ ] 1.4 Add `notebooks/phase1-baseline.ipynb` documenting EDA, preprocessing, and training steps.
- [ ] 1.5 Add unit tests and an integration smoke test that runs training on a small subset and verifies output and metrics.
- [ ] 1.6 Add a CI workflow `.github/workflows/ml-baseline.yml` that runs the smoke test and reports metrics.
- [ ] 1.7 Update README with instructions to run the baseline locally.

## Phase 2 — (placeholder)
- [ ] 2.1 [reserved for model comparison and hyperparameter tuning]

## Phase 3 — (placeholder)
- [ ] 3.1 [reserved for deployment / monitoring]
